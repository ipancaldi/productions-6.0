"""The Studio Agent API — 127.0.0.1:3902.

The host's only counterpart. It holds no take, writes nothing, and talks to
nobody but the model: a function of (scene snapshot + images + conversation) → a
plan. The contract is `../AGENT-BRIDGE.md`.

Run:
    6.0/agent/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn serve:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3902 \
        --app-dir 6.0/agent --reload

Which interpreter answers is decided in `interpreter()` below and reported by
`/health`: the real agent when a credential exists, and the deterministic stub
otherwise — or always, with `AGENT_STUB=1`. The stub is not a fallback nobody
wants; it is how the panels get designed without spending a token.
